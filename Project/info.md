# Project ideas (to be listed there)
* Based on flight route data --> see what's amount of the route can be discared while keeping a sufficient connections of all the places (we might elaborate on that)
* Cinema data --> Generate a network of actors (linked if they have played in the same movie), can be used for movie suggestion or for carreer advices
* La poste or another delivery company data --> Find routes and stockage points to see if the delivery can be optimized 
* Cocktails --> Every alcohol or soft is a node and each cocktail is used to link beverages together. To find what are the hub and optimize bar purchases.
* EPFL mailing lists --> Every @epfl.ch is a node and these are linked if the appear to be part of the same maling list. Could highlight some unexpected links.
